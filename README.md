# Chatbot - Gemini of Gemini
I coded main and sidebar so far. Spent a lot of time one styling issue. But so far it looks great.
I coded some components and logic behind of the app. I try to make it as reactive as possible. And copy all of the Gemini's actions. So far I can send and get data and retrive previous datas and store them for future usages.  Styling is finished in this step and fully focus on other features.

To be continue...
